Feature B
=========

What is feature B
-----------------

An exciting new feature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Explain why it is exciting, maybe make a few examples:

1. Exciting reason 1;
#. Exciting reason 2;
#. Some other exciting reason!

Take for example this python function::

    #Isn't this exciting?
    def exciting_function(exciting_parameter1=0)
        do_something_exciting(exciting_parameter)

The results are also, of course, quite exciting:
